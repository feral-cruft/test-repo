re
Does this thing "Sync-Automatically" ? ~ *Doing STUFF ALL WRONG, on github*

some thoughts...
hmm... i don't know much what i am doing here too
i sometimes use github just to host stuff (like this stuff). and just upload new files or edit them in-place with the online gitbub interface.  
far as i know, there is no automagical synch
