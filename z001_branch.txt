Current branch (master) [test-repo]


GitHub Desktop ~ (Still showing repo "origin" my-repo).

This file has been commited 3 minutes ago. (As an empty file). 
SAVED with some text inside it now - [8:15 PM 30/11/2017 QLD-DST Time ] #!~
GitHUB-Desktop / github.com ~ Seems to prevent THIS kinda "save" (workflow) - AFTER creating the file.
AND :: At the same time remember EVERY little thing I type in here.


Does this thing "Sync-Automatically" ? ~ *Doing STUFF ALL WRONG, on github*

OTHER NOTEs
REPO - test-repo has its own directory on the local-system (w7Pro).


REF  :: z010_MAKE_Branch.png

With regards to file z000_cloned.txt ~ (LocalFILE on \\z97) - Now removed from the local-git-repo.

NEW-FILEs

	z001_branch.txt
	z010_MAKE_Branch.png

You must be on a branch to make or propse changes to this file (z000_cloned.txt) ~ ummm.

But it has been removed from the local-repo.


I really make these things difficult from myself.
I can put it back, with the text that was keyed in.
AND :: github will probably make version of EACH and every change.
