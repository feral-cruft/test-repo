#### Does this thing "Sync-Automatically" ?  
  
some thoughts...  
hmm... i don't know much what i am doing here too  
probly *Doing STUFF ALL WRONG, on github*  

in this case i / we probly am / are  
far as i know, there is no automagical (as per google-drive or drop-box) synch.  
so...

if u edit a file remotely (via gitbhub web page) ,ur local version of the file won't update until u fire up ur local github client-app-of-choice and perform some specific action.  
  
similarly if u edit a local file, remote file won't update until u actually do something from ur end.  

the synchronisation itself (via git) is muchly automated (what the platrorm app was made for i guess) BUT it won't happen until YOU take some action at ur end and EXPLICITLY command that it be so.  

"Let there Be Synchronisation!" and then There Will Be Much Synchronisation, and The Synchronisation will be Automagical.  
erm...  
at least i think that's how github / git is supposed to be used (the 'rignt' way).  
  
so editing stuff in-place like this may or may not be the 'right' way to use github, but github justa nutha gadget, so if it helps achieve whatever u are attempting at the time, even if its just jotting down stuff like this in a handy text editor, that's not the 'wrong' way to use github, that's just Overkill!  

yay
Overkill is Awesome!
